Description

Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows a computer to access files over a network as if they were on its local storage. It is commonly used to centralize file storage, making it easier to share data between multiple Linux systems. An NFS server hosts the shared directories, and clients mount these directories to use them seamlessly.

Short Description

This project sets up a basic NFS server for sharing files across a network, enabling multiple systems to access and use a common directory as local storage.
